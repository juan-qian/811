### Personal Background
I am a doctoral student in the Political Science Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My fields of interest are political methodology and comparative politics.

Prior to graduate school, I served as an Associate in Research at the Margolis Center for Health Policy at Duke University from 2016-18. Additionally, I worked for several government agencies and and think tanks, including Minnesota Senate, Office of Minnesota Governor, and American Enterprise Institute.

My hometown is Nanjing, a city in eastern China. I graduated from Macalester College with a B.A. in political science in 2014 and obtained his Master of Public Policy from Georgetown University in 2016.

### Research Interests
I am interested in how the Chinese citizens' attitudes toward government vary by province and a respondent's personal characteristics. 

### Questions I hope to answer
Does a citizen's approval of Chinese government performance varies by province and gender?

### Relevant Data
China Family Panel Studies (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/36524)'s 2014 data

China Multi-Generational Panel Dataset, Liaoning (CMGPD-LN), 1749-1909 (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/27063)

### Data Visualization
To answer this question, I calculated and created a plot that shows the citizens' average attitudes toward government in each province, breaking up by gender.
```{r ggplot, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
dat <- read.csv("data/CFPS.csv")
ggplot() +
  # define y = state for all layers
  aes(y = dat$province) +
  # x = points for each actor
  geom_point(aes(x = dat$male_approval), shape = "M", color= "blue", size=3) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = dat$female_approval), shape = "F", color= "red", size=3) +
  ggtitle("PRC Citizen's Attitudes toward Government, by Province") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = dat$male_approval, 
                   xend = dat$female_approval, 
                   yend = dat$province), 
               color = "grey", 
               size = 3, 
               lineend = "round", 
               alpha = .3) +
  labs(y = "Province", 
       x = "Local Government Approval (best=1, worst=5)", size=3)
```
